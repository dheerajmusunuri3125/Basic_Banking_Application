# Basic_Banking_Application
This program is a basic banking application in Java. It simulates a bank where customers can:  Login (or create a new account if they are new).  View their account details.  Deposit money.  Withdraw money.  Check balance.  Currently, it’s console-based, but you’re extending it towards a GUI (with Swing login page).
