# Basic_Banking_Application

This program is a basic banking application in Java. It simulates a bank where customers can:  Login (or create a new account if they are new).  View their account details.  Deposit money.  Withdraw money.  Check balance.  Currently, itâ€™s console-based, but youâ€™re extending it towards a GUI (with Swing login page).

Important Components

1. Customer Class

This class stores customer details:

name â†’ Customerâ€™s name.

address â†’ Where they live.

phonenumber â†’ Their phone number.

balance â†’ Current balance (starts with some default or deposited money).

withdrawlamount â†’ Withdrawal amount (used when withdrawing).

It has:

Setters & Getters â†’ to safely update and retrieve customer details.

display() â†’ prints customer details neatly.


Bank Class (Main Class)

This is where the logic runs. It contains:

A List<Customer> to store multiple customers (acts like our "database").

A menu-driven system:

If user is new â†’ asks for details (name, address, phone, deposit amount) and creates an account.

If user is existing â†’ asks for name, searches in the list, and shows their details.


Planned GUI Version

In the Swing-based version:

A Login Page will allow existing customers to log in.

A Registration Page will allow new customers to sign up.

After login, a Dashboard will show options:

Deposit

Withdraw

Check Balance

View Account Details

This will make the program user-friendly and interactive instead of console-based.

ðŸ“Œ Limitations

Currently, data is lost every time you close the program (no database yet).

No password-based authentication (only name search is used).

Balance is stored per object, but not persistent.

Needs validation (e.g., canâ€™t withdraw more than balance

getRemaingBalance() â†’ shows balance after withdrawal.
